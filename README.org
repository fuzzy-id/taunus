* Taunus – Your access to your disk… For free!

This is Taunus! Taunus is supposed to be a small application working
on top of Pyramid[fn:1], granting you access on your file system in
order to make sharing in LANs a bit easier and to learn a bit more
about the Pyramid framework (one could also say that the latter is the
aim topic).

** Current supported features

None, er, this is not working at all, at the moment!
